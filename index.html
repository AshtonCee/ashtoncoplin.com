        <p class="about-me-p-text">Hello, I'm Ashton, a dedicated programmer who's looking to make their mark on the world and exceed
            in my chosen career field of Computer Science, in both the technical and research aspects. I'm currently a 
            student at the University of Kansas, enrolled in the School of Engineering, and am expected to graduate in
            the spring of 2026. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-me-p-text">
            Driven by my own creativity and passion, I've been making and procuring a wide variety of projects in order to
            further hone my programming skills. I want to one day become a fullstack software engineer, so I try to make every
            project I create have an efficient backend, as well as a user friendly frontend. I excel at problem-solving the
            various issues that arise during my work, as well as bringing my creative vision to life.
        </p>
        <p class="about-me-p-text">
            My drive to learn and further my experience with the various programming languages and frameworks that are present
            everywhere throughout this field has led me to create a wide variety of projects. Technical projects which 
            taught me data manipulation, the libraries to do said manipulation, backend engineering, and much more are commonplace
            in my repetoire. Frontend development is another field in which I have a wide variety of experience, teaching me many
            languages and frameworks to help me create my creative vision.
